# 1 Introduction

This lab report presents the efforts and outcomes of our team in enhancing unit tests for the JFreeChart library using coverage tools such as EclEmma. Our team collaborated to improve the testing coverage of the software under test (SUT) by applying various white-box testing techniques.

In this lab, we built upon our previous assignment by focusing on improving the coverage of unit tests through the utilization of coverage tools and manual data-flow coverage calculations. By drawing data flow graphs and deriving def-use pairs, we aimed to enhance the effectiveness of our test cases and ensure comprehensive coverage of the codebase.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Our team, consisting of Gopal, Usman, Jubayer, Robby, and Ehsaan, devised a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure thorough coverage and effective testing of the new unit. We began by utilizing coverage tools to identify areas requiring improvement and to guide the creation of new test cases.

Usman took the lead in writing unit tests for previously uncovered methods in DataUtilities and Range, including clone(), equals(), and variations of calculateColumnTotal and calculateRowTotal. Emphasis was placed on designing new tests to meet coverage requirements by considering boundary and branch decisions.

Gopal focused on addressing poor coverage performance in existing tests, particularly in methods like equals() in the Range class. By identifying areas of low coverage within methods, adjustments were made to existing tests to cover these segments effectively.

Jubayer emphasized the utility of coverage tools in identifying missed branches and guiding the creation of new test cases. This white-box approach aided in understanding method purposes and enhancing unit testing practices.

Robby's strategy involved a thorough understanding of each method's functionality, followed by the identification of key test cases. Ehsaan played a crucial role in achieving comprehensive code coverage, enabling us to systematically test each method individually.

Overall, our strategy prioritized thorough method coverage, guided by insights from coverage tools and a systematic approach to test case creation, ensuring the robustness and reliability of our unit testing process.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

# Pros:

## Easy Integration:
Both Gopal and Usman found that EclEmma integrated smoothly with Eclipse, reducing setup time and streamlining the testing process.

## Visualization: 
Jubayer highlighted the advantage of visualizing branch, method, and statement coverages with percentage indicators, making it easier to assess the extent of test coverage.

## Comprehensive Reports: 
Robby appreciated EclEmma's detailed coverage reports, which facilitated the identification of areas requiring further testing.

## Highlighting Features:
Ehsaan noted EclEmma's feature to highlight covered and uncovered parts of the code, enhancing comprehensibility and aiding in identifying areas for improvement.

# Cons:

## IDE Dependency: 
Gopal mentioned the need to switch from VSCode to Eclipse to use EclEmma, which could disrupt the development environment and workflow.

## Limited Metrics: 
EclEmma lacks certain metrics like condition and path coverage, which may limit its effectiveness in providing a comprehensive understanding of test coverage.

## Lack of Specificity: 
Both Usman and Jubayer pointed out the challenge of not having clear highlights on specific missed lines of code, requiring additional effort to identify potential gaps in test coverage.

## Language Limitation: 
Robby highlighted that EclEmma is limited to Java and does not support other programming languages like C++ or Python, which could be a drawback for projects involving multiple languages.

Overall, while coverage tools like EclEmma offer several benefits such as ease of use and comprehensive reporting, they also have limitations related to their integration, metrics coverage, specificity, and language support. These factors should be considered when selecting a coverage tool for testing projects.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.


# Advantages of Requirements-Based Testing:

## Effective for Complexity: 
Particularly useful for large or complex code segments where understanding the requirements is crucial for testing comprehensively.

## Black Box Testing:
Testers do not need access to the code, enabling them to test the software from a user's perspective without being influenced by internal implementation details.

## User vs. Developer Perspective: 
Helps in identifying discrepancies between user expectations and developer implementations, leading to more user-centric testing.

# Disadvantages of Requirements-Based Testing:

## Inefficiency: 
Testers may lack knowledge about the software's internal details, leading to inefficient testing and potential gaps in coverage.

## Limited Scope:
Only specific scenarios are tested, potentially missing edge cases and leading to incomplete bug discovery.

## Poor Documentation: 
Insufficient documentation on methods and classes can hinder the writing of unit tests, making it challenging to ensure comprehensive coverage.

# Advantages of Coverage-Based Testing:

## Analyzable Metrics:
Coverage tools provide easy-to-analyze and unbiased metrics, helping testers assess the extent of test coverage more objectively.

## Access to Code:
Testers have access to the code, enabling them to use logical reasoning to identify bugs and security issues more effectively.

## Understanding Code Usage: 
Allows testers to gain a better understanding of where specific methods and classes are used and their intended purpose within the application.

# Disadvantages of Coverage-Based Testing:

## Lack of Critical Section Coverage:
Does not guarantee coverage of critical sections of the code, as coverage tools cannot determine which methods or sections are critical to the application's functionality.

## Tool Selection Complexity:
With many coverage tools available, it can be challenging to determine which tool best suits the project's needs.

## Knowledge and Access Requirements: 
Testers need extensive knowledge about the System Under Test (SUT) and access to the code, which may not always be feasible.

## Focus on Code Coverage Over Edge Cases:
There's a risk that testers may prioritize writing tests to achieve high code coverage instead of focusing on testing edge cases that the code may not handle adequately.
