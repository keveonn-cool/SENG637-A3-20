# 1 Introduction

This lab report presents the efforts and outcomes of our team in enhancing unit tests for the JFreeChart library using coverage tools such as EclEmma. Our team collaborated to improve the testing coverage of the software under test (SUT) by applying various white-box testing techniques.

In this lab, we built upon our previous assignment by focusing on improving the coverage of unit tests through the utilization of coverage tools and manual data-flow coverage calculations. By drawing data flow graphs and deriving def-use pairs, we aimed to enhance the effectiveness of our test cases and ensure comprehensive coverage of the codebase.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Our team, consisting of Gopal, Usman, Jubayer, Robby, and Ehsaan, devised a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure thorough coverage and effective testing of the new unit. We began by utilizing coverage tools to identify areas requiring improvement and to guide the creation of new test cases.

Usman took the lead in writing unit tests for previously uncovered methods in DataUtilities and Range, including clone(), equals(), and variations of calculateColumnTotal and calculateRowTotal. Emphasis was placed on designing new tests to meet coverage requirements by considering boundary and branch decisions.

Gopal focused on addressing poor coverage performance in existing tests, particularly in methods like equals() in the Range class. By identifying areas of low coverage within methods, adjustments were made to existing tests to cover these segments effectively.

Jubayer emphasized the utility of coverage tools in identifying missed branches and guiding the creation of new test cases. This white-box approach aided in understanding method purposes and enhancing unit testing practices.

Robby's strategy involved a thorough understanding of each method's functionality, followed by the identification of key test cases. Ehsaan played a crucial role in achieving comprehensive code coverage, enabling us to systematically test each method individually.

Overall, our strategy prioritized thorough method coverage, guided by insights from coverage tools and a systematic approach to test case creation, ensuring the robustness and reliability of our unit testing process.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

# Pros:

## Easy Integration:
Both Gopal and Usman found that EclEmma integrated smoothly with Eclipse, reducing setup time and streamlining the testing process.

## Visualization: 
Jubayer highlighted the advantage of visualizing branch, method, and statement coverages with percentage indicators, making it easier to assess the extent of test coverage.

## Comprehensive Reports: 
Robby appreciated EclEmma's detailed coverage reports, which facilitated the identification of areas requiring further testing.

## Highlighting Features:
Ehsaan noted EclEmma's feature to highlight covered and uncovered parts of the code, enhancing comprehensibility and aiding in identifying areas for improvement.

# Cons:

## IDE Dependency: 
Gopal mentioned the need to switch from VSCode to Eclipse to use EclEmma, which could disrupt the development environment and workflow.

## Limited Metrics: 
EclEmma lacks certain metrics like condition and path coverage, which may limit its effectiveness in providing a comprehensive understanding of test coverage.

## Lack of Specificity: 
Both Usman and Jubayer pointed out the challenge of not having clear highlights on specific missed lines of code, requiring additional effort to identify potential gaps in test coverage.

## Language Limitation: 
Robby highlighted that EclEmma is limited to Java and does not support other programming languages like C++ or Python, which could be a drawback for projects involving multiple languages.

Overall, while coverage tools like EclEmma offer several benefits such as ease of use and comprehensive reporting, they also have limitations related to their integration, metrics coverage, specificity, and language support. These factors should be considered when selecting a coverage tool for testing projects.
